# Project Title: Vehicle Tracking and Lane Detection

## Project Description
This project involves tracking vehicles, detecting lane changes, and estimating vehicle speeds using YOLOv8 and Python with OpenCV. The system is designed to identify vehicles, detect lane violations, and flag vehicles that exceed speed limits.

### Features:
- Vehicle tracking with bounding boxes.
- Lane change detection.
- Speed estimation and alerts for speeding.
- Counts vehicles crossing a line.
- Displays vehicle types and counts on the frame.
